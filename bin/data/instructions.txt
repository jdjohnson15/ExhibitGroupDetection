How to start the program:

====================================

How to use the config file:


“#” <- this is a comment. This wont be read by the program
“List A” <- says the following video files are for list A (the calm videos)
“List B” <- says the following video files are for list b (the chaos videos)

Put all video files in the “data” folder (full path is Iceline_of/bin/data)

Make sure the names in the config file match the names of the video files, including extension (.mov, mp4, etc)
