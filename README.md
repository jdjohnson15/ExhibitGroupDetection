# ExhibitGroupDetection
An experimental exhibit space needed to display content triggered groups of people forming in a gallery space. Using OpenCV and ceiling-mounted cameras, with an OpenFrameworks interface, I built a system to find groups of people in a random spot around a room. If the group stays in a spot too long, the system finds a group in another spot.
